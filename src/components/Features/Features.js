          <p>
            Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously
            placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so one should never
            be too far away.

          <h3>Pick your scooter</h3>
          <p>
            We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So
            you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how much
            it will cost.

            Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock,
            put on a helmet, and youâ€™re off! Always lock bikes away from
            walkways and accessibility ramps.
